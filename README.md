# Welcome to Phase 3

## Introduction

Learning Objectives
Welcome to Phase 3! At this point in the program, you've mastered the frontend:
you've gained proficiency in one language, JavaScript, and can use React to make
single-page applications that access data from an API (either on a server that
someone else runs, or on your own json-server). You can officially call yourself
a frontend developer! ðŸŽ‰

By now, you've likely felt the limitation of what you can build without having a
real backend. Fear not! This is the point in the program when that all changes,
and you become full-stack developers.

In this phase, you'll learn a new language, Python, which has some similarities
to JavaScript as well as its own set of unique features that make it a much
beloved language. You'll also learn how to use Python to interact with a SQL
database where you can control how data is persisted. With those tools, you'll
be able to build out your very own simple backend API so that your next project
can take advantage of all the benefits of full-stack development.

By the end of the phase, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Python as a language, including principles of
  object-oriented programming.
- Understand the characteristics of a relational database.
- Perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) actions with a database via an
  Object-Relational Mapper.

Use the next lesson in this module to confirm that your Python environment is
set up correctly, then get started with **Python Fundamentals**.

Happy coding!
